### CSS Specificity
The universal selector * is often used to apply a style to all elements on the page.  

`*  {
     margin: 0;
     padding: 0;
   }`    

This can help to remove default settings from browsers.  

**Type selectors** specificity value is `(0, 0, 0, 1)`. 

The `!important` keyword in CSS is used to give a style rule the highest priority, allowing it to override
any other declarations for a property.
